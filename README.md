# PowerBi
This repository contains the source file (FINANCIAL DASHBOARD - 1.pbix) for a comprehensive, interactive Financial Dashboard built in Power BI. This dashboard is designed to provide users with a clear, visual overview of key financial performance indicators (KPIs) and enable deep-dive analysis into financial data.

# Dashboard Overview
The dashboard utilizes a robust data model and various visual elements to transform raw financial figures into actionable insights. While the exact metrics and visualizations are contained within the .pbix file, the structure indicates a focus on presenting and analyzing core financial data.

# Key Components and Features
The Power BI file structure suggests the inclusion of the following:

1.Report Layout and Visualizations (Report/Layout):

* Contains the visual design, interactive elements (slicers, filters, buttons), and specific charts/tables used to present the financial data.

* The layout is designed for high impact, potentially utilizing a custom theme (CY25SU10.json) for a consistent and professional look.

2.Data Model (DataModel):

* This is the core of the analysis, housing all data connections, tables, and the relationships defined between them.

* It contains the underlying financial figures, calculated measures (DAX formulas), and hierarchical structures essential for filtering and aggregations.

* The presence of calculated metrics is highly likely, covering areas such as:
  Revenue and Sales Performance
  Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Operating Expenses
  Profitability (Gross Profit, Net Income)
  Trend Analysis (e.g., Year-over-Year, Month-over-Month comparisons)

3.Custom Theme (Report/StaticResources/.../CY25SU10.json):
  A custom JSON theme is referenced, suggesting the dashboard uses a predefined set of colors, fonts, and visual styling        rules to maintain brand consistency and readability.

4.Static Background Image (Report/StaticResources/.../photo-background-green-texture529530973746628.jpg):
   A specific static image file is used as a background element, indicating a professional or themed visual presentation.
